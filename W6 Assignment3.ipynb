    "1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs are bits of software that act as interpreters for two different programs. They’ll connect to each service via endpoints and relay messages back and forth, doing the work of software integration for you.\n",
    "Private APIs, also known as internal or closed APIs, are application programming interfaces that are intended for use within a specific organization or company. Unlike public APIs that are accessible to external developers and the public, private APIs are restricted and accessible only to authorized users, usually within the same organization that owns the API.\n",
    "Streaming Services\n",
    "Netflix, Spotify, and other streaming services have to distribute media to nearly any device. Whether the user is on a Windows PC, an iPad, a smart TV, or something else, there’s an expectation that they’ll be able to stream content. Streaming services get this done with an API, ensuring their content is compatible with any device.\n",
    "Financial Apps\n",
    "Your bank makes use of an internal API to manage all aspects of your finances, from checking and savings accounts to credit cards or CDs. Customer service will require a different set of software than the technical aspects of account management, but these functions need to connect. An API keeps these departments tied together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages and disadvantages of API infrastructure:\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "1.\tIncreased Interoperability: API solutions enable different software systems to communicate with each other, regardless of their programming language or platform. This enhances the interoperability between systems, allowing for the exchange of data and functionality.\n",
    "2.\tImproved Efficiency: API driven infrastructures enable developers to reuse code and functionality from existing software systems, saving time and reducing the amount of code that needs to be written from scratch.\n",
    "3.\tBetter User Experience: APIs can enable third-party developers to create applications that integrate with existing software systems, providing a better user experience and increased functionality.\n",
    "4.\tIncreased Flexibility: APIs provide developers with greater flexibility, enabling them to choose the best programming languages and frameworks for their needs.\n",
    "5.\tNew Revenue Streams: APIs can enable companies to create new revenue streams by providing third-party developers with access to their software systems.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "1.\tSecurity Concerns: API infrastructures can be vulnerable to security breaches, such as SQL injection attacks and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, making it crucial to implement security measures to protect against these threats.\n",
    "2.\tComplexity: APIs can be complex, requiring a significant amount of development effort to implement and maintain.\n",
    "3.\tCompatibility Issues: APIs can have compatibility issues between different versions of the same software system or between different systems, which can lead to errors and system failures.\n",
    "4.\tDependency on Third-Party Developers: APIs rely on third-party developers to create applications that integrate with the software system. This can create dependencies that are outside of the control of the company that owns the software system.\n",
    "5.\tGovernance and Management: APIs require proper governance and management to ensure they are being used correctly and consistently across different applications and systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.\n",
    "A Web API is simply an interface to access server resources over HTTP. The term refers to the concept rather than any specific technology — a Web API can be built with various technologies, like Java and ASP.NET. Web APIs use an open-source interface and leverage many client entities like browsers, smartphones, tablets, and laptops.\n",
    "Architecture Differences\n",
    "While Web APIs and REST APIs have similar architectural patterns, they also have some key differences.\n",
    "•\tClient and server-side coordination: REST APIs have loosely coupled architecture, allowing for independent development on the client and server side. With Web APIs, changes between client and server are more finely coordinated.\n",
    "•\tInterface: Depending on implementation details, REST APIs tend to use industry-standard interfaces. Web APIs use custom interfaces, depending on the API provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "SOAP APIs\n",
    "SOAP is a protocol that defines rigid communication rules. It has several associated standards that control every aspect of the data exchange. For example, here are some standards SOAP uses:\n",
    "•\tWeb Services Security (WS-Security) specifies security measures like using unique identifiers called tokens\n",
    "•\tWeb Services Addressing (WS-Addressing) requires including routing information as metadata\n",
    "•\tWS-ReliableMessaging standardizes error handling in SOAP messaging\n",
    "•\tWeb Services Description Language (WSDL) describes the scope and function of SOAP web services\n",
    "When you send a request to a SOAP API, you must wrap your HTTP request in a SOAP envelope. This is a data structure that modifies the underlying HTTP content with SOAP request requirements. Due to the envelope, you can also send requests to SOAP web services with other transport protocols, like TCP or Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). However, SOAP APIs and SOAP web services always return XML documents in their responses.\n",
    "REST APIs\n",
    "REST is a software architectural style that imposes six conditions on how an API should work. These are the six principles REST APIs follow:\n",
    "1.\tClient-server architecture. The sender and receiver are independent of each other regarding technology, platforming, programming language, and so on.\n",
    "2.\tLayered. The server can have several intermediaries that work together to complete client requests, but they are invisible to the client.\n",
    "3.\tUniform interface. The API returns data in a standard format that is complete and fully useable.\n",
    "4.\tStateless. The API completes every new request independently of previous requests.\n",
    "5.\tCacheable. All API responses are cacheable.\n",
    "6.\tCode on demand. The API response can include a code snippet if required.\n",
    "You send REST requests using HTTP verbs like GET and POST. Rest API responses are typically in JSON but can also be of a different data format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SOAP protocol requires applications to store the state between requests, which increases bandwidth and memory requirements. As a result, it makes applications expensive and challenging to scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Differentiate between REST and SOAP.\n",
    "Key differences: SOAP vs REST\n",
    "SOAP is a protocol, while REST is an architectural style. This creates significant differences in how SOAP APIs and REST APIs behave.\n",
    "Design\n",
    "The SOAP API exposes functions or operations, while REST APIs are data-driven. For example, consider an application with employee data that other applications can manipulate. The application's SOAP API could expose a function called CreateEmployee. To create an employee, you would specify the function name in your SOAP message when sending a request.\n",
    "However, the application's REST API could expose a URL called /employees, and a POST request to that URL would create a new employee record.\n",
    "Flexibility\n",
    "SOAP APIs are rigid and only allow XML messaging between applications. The application server also has to maintain the state of each client. This means it has to remember all previous requests when processing a new request.\n",
    "REST is more flexible and allows applications to transfer data as plain text, HTML, XML, and JSON. REST is also stateless, so the REST API treats every new request independently of previous requests.\n",
    "Performance\n",
    "SOAP messages are larger and more complex, which makes them slower to transmit and process. This can increase page load times.\n",
    "REST is faster and more efficient than SOAP due to the smaller message sizes of REST. REST responses are also cacheable, so the server can store frequently accessed data in a cache for even shorter page load times.\n",
    "Scalability\n",
    "The SOAP protocol requires applications to store the state between requests, which increases bandwidth and memory requirements. As a result, it makes applications expensive and challenging to scale.\n",
    "Unlike SOAP, REST permits stateless and layered architecture, which makes it more scalable. For example, the application server can pass the request to other servers or allow an intermediary (like a content delivery network) to handle it.\n",
    "Security\n",
    "SOAP requires an additional layer of WS-Security to work with HTTPS. WS-Security uses additional header content to ensure only the designated process in the specified server reads the SOAP message content. This adds communication overheads and negatively impacts performance.\n",
    "REST supports HTTPS without additional overheads.\n",
    "Reliability\n",
    "SOAP has error handling logic built into it, and it provides more reliability. On the other hand, REST requires you to try again in case of communication failures, and it’s less reliable.\n",
